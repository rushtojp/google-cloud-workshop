Here's a guide on how to get your free Google Cloud account set up.

Setting Up Your Free Google Cloud Account
This guide will walk you through creating a Google Cloud account, which comes with a $300 credit for 90 days and access to an "Always Free" tier of services.

What you'll need:

A standard Google account (like your Gmail).

A credit or debit card. (This is only for identity verification; you won't be charged unless you manually upgrade to a paid plan later).

1. Getting Started
First, head over to the Google Cloud free page: cloud.google.com/free

Click the big blue button that says “Get started for free”. It will ask you to log in with your Google account if you haven't already.

2. Basic Info
The first screen is simple. Just confirm your country and agree to the terms of service. Click continue. You'll then be asked to verify your phone number with a code sent via SMS.

3. The Payment Verification Step
This is the part that worries some people, but it's straightforward. Google asks for payment details to make sure you're a real person and not a bot creating endless trial accounts.

Account Type: Choose "Individual".

Payment Details: Enter your card number, name, and address. Make sure the details match what your bank has on file.

Again, Google will not charge you. They place a temporary authorization hold for a tiny amount (like $1 or less) that is automatically refunded within a few days.

Once you fill this out, click “Start my free trial”.

4. You're In!
After the verification, you’ll be taken to the Google Cloud Console. This is your main dashboard where you can start creating virtual machines, databases, storage buckets, and more.

What You Get & How to Manage Costs
Your new account comes with two benefits:

$300 Free Trial Credit: You have 90 days to use $300 on pretty much any service you want. This is great for trying out more powerful features.

Always Free Tier: After your trial ends, you can still use a certain amount of specific services for free every month. This includes a small e2-micro virtual machine, 5 GB of storage, and more. It's perfect for small personal projects.

A crucial tip to avoid any surprise bills:

Your account is set to not automatically bill you after the trial. You have to manually click an "Upgrade" button to become a paid customer.

For extra safety, set up a billing alert.

From the main menu (☰), go to Billing.

On the left menu, find and click on Budgets & alerts.

Click Create Budget.

Set a budget amount of just $1.

Set it to send you an email alert when 100% of that budget is used.

This way, if your usage ever goes beyond the free limits, you’ll get an email immediately and can decide what to do next.
