5. Firestore
Class Notes: Concepts
What is it? A flexible, scalable document NoSQL database for mobile, web, and server development. It's part of the Firebase platform.

Key Concepts:

Document-Oriented: Data is stored in Documents (which are like JSON objects).

Collections: Documents live in Collections (which are like folders for documents).

Example: A users collection contains user_A and user_B documents. The user_A document contains fields like name: "Alice" and email: "alice@example.com".

Key Features:

Real-time Synchronization: This is its killer feature. When data changes in the database, it's pushed to all connected clients (web/mobile apps) automatically.

Offline Support: The SDKs (Software Development Kits) for web and mobile can cache data locally, so your app works even when the user is offline.

Scales to Zero: It's serverless. If you have no traffic, you pay nothing.

Firestore vs. Bigtable:

Use Firestore for general-purpose web/mobile app development (user profiles, game state, chat messages).

Use Bigtable for massive-scale (petabyte) analytical or time-series data.

Lab 5: The Real-time Document Database
Goal: Use the GCP Console to manually create a document database structure.

Navigate to Firestore: In the GCP Console, go to Firestore.

Select a Database Mode:

Click "Select Native Mode" (this is the standard Firestore).

Choose a Location:

Select a region near you (e.g., us-central).

Click "Create Database".

Start a Collection:

Click "+ Start Collection".

Collection ID: users

Click "Next".

Create Your First Document:

Document ID: Click "Auto-ID".

Field: name (Type: string) -> Value: Alice

Click "+ Add Field": email (Type: string) -> Value: alice@example.com

Click "+ Add Field": age (Type: number) -> Value: 30

Click "Save".

Add a Second Document:

While in the users collection, click "+ Add Document".

Document ID: bob (we'll set this one manually).

Field: name (string) -> Bob

Field: interests (Type: array)

Value 0: gcp

Click + to add another array value: Value 1: hiking

Click "Save".

Add a Sub-collection:

Click on your alice document (the one with the auto-ID).

Click "+ Start Collection".

Collection ID: orders

Document ID: order-101

Field: item (string) -> Laptop

Field: quantity (number) -> 1

Click "Save".

You have now created a users collection, with a document for alice, which itself contains an orders sub-collection. This is the power of the document model.

Cleanup:

Click the three dots (...) next to the users collection and select "Delete collection". This will delete all documents and sub-collections within it.
