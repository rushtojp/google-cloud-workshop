1. Cloud Storage
Class Notes: Concepts
What is it? Cloud Storage is Google's object storage service. It's infinitely scalable, highly durable, and cost-effective.

Key Concept: Objects vs. Filesystems:

You store "objects" (files) in "buckets."

It is not a file system. You can't "mount" a bucket like a network drive (for that, you use Cloud Filestore).

Think of it as a massive, infinitely scalable key-value store where the key is the object name (e.g., images/puppy.jpg) and the value is the data.

Key Components:

Buckets: The top-level containers that hold your objects. Bucket names must be globally unique.

Objects: The individual files (images, videos, backups, logs) you store.

Storage Classes: These control cost and availability.

Standard: For "hot" data accessed frequently (e.g., website assets).

Nearline: For data accessed less than once a month (e.g., backups).

Coldline: For data accessed less than once a quarter (e.g., archives).

Archive: For long-term archival/disaster recovery, accessed less than once a year.

Object Lifecycle Management: This is a crucial feature. It's a set of rules you apply to a bucket to automate data management and save costs.

Example Rule 1: "If an object is older than 30 days, move it from Standard to Nearline."

Example Rule 2: "If an object in the 'Archive' class is older than 7 years, delete it."

Common Use Cases:

Serving static website content (images, CSS, JS).

Storing backups and archives.

The "landing zone" for data in a data lake (e.g., raw logs, batch data).

Lab 1: The Versatile Bucket
Goal: Create a bucket, upload a file, make it public, and set a lifecycle rule.

Navigate to Cloud Storage: In the GCP Console, go to Cloud Storage > Buckets.

Create a Bucket:

Click "Create".

Name: Give it a globally unique name (e.g., [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]-masterclass-bucket).

Location: Choose Region and select a region near you (e.g., us-central1).

Storage Class: Choose Standard for the default.

Access Control: Select Uniform.

Click "Create".

Upload an Object:

Click on your new bucket's name.

Click "Upload files" and pick any small image or text file from your computer (e.g., test.txt).

Make the Object Public (for a static website):

Find your uploaded file in the list and click the three dots (...) at the end of its row.

Select "Edit access".

Click "Add Entry".

Entity: Select Public.

Name: Enter allUsers.

Role: Select Storage Object Viewer.

Click "Save". Your file now has a public URL. Click the file name and find the "Public URL" to test it in your browser.

Set a Lifecycle Rule:

Click on your bucket's name to go to its details page.

Click the "Lifecycle" tab.

Click "Add a rule".

Action: Select Set storage class to Coldline.

Object condition: Select Age and enter 30 days.

Click "Continue", then "Create".

Congratulations! You've just automated your storage costs.

Cleanup: Click the "Delete" button for the object, and then go back to the Buckets list and delete your bucket.
