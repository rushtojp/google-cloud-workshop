Here are five step-by-step labs, one for each of the Google Cloud security topics you requested.

Important Prerequisites for All Labs
GCP Project: You must have a Google Cloud Project.

Permissions: You need the Owner or Editor role in the project to enable APIs and create resources.

gcloud CLI: Have the Google Cloud CLI installed and authenticated (gcloud auth login).

Enable APIs: Before starting each lab, you may need to enable its specific API. A good practice is to enable all of them at the start:

Bash

gcloud services enable \
    iam.googleapis.com \
    iap.googleapis.com \
    identityplatform.googleapis.com \
    cloudkms.googleapis.com \
    accesscontextmanager.googleapis.com \
    compute.googleapis.com \
    storage.googleapis.com
